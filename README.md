In above scenery the both "you" and "your-friend" will be two github(remontely/internet)-roles.

For testing you can replace "your-friend"(which means the remotely-peer dialog) with local-peer.

So in this case you can remotely-chating beetwen "you-remote from github" with "you-local from your PC/Laptop/Computer".

For that close the browser if have something opened(in Browser) which running in the past and then:

   a. you: download this repository into your desktop
   
   b. click to run locally the batch file "runAsAdmin_p2p_handshake.bat"
   
   c. follow the above steps...(where replace "your-friend"-role with "you"-role :)...enjoy!

   Also can be both roles("you" and"your-friendly") can running locally or in separate PC-machine.

   
   
   So the roles("you" and"your-friendly") can running in any combination of locally(on PC) and/or remotely(github or other CDn or other hosting)

   Finally, if want to have and file-transfer facility and/or the recording of audio-conversation in your show-case then you can consult <a href="https://github.com/svarunan/serverless-webrtc/tree/master">that</a> original-repository(thanks a lot for this code)
